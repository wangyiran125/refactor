//If you have been working for a while with a class hierarchy, it can easily become
//        too tangled for its own good. Refactoring the hierarchy often involves pushing
//        methods and fields up and down the hierarchy. After you¡¯ve done this you can well
//        find you have a subclass that isn¡¯t adding any value, so you need to merge the
//        classes together
