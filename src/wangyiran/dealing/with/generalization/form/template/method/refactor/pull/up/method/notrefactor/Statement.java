//Before I can use Form Template Method (345) I need to arrange things so that
//        the two methods are subclasses of some common superclass. I do this by using a
//        method object [Beck] to create a separate strategy hierarchy for printing the
//        statements (Figure 11.1)
public class Statement {
}
